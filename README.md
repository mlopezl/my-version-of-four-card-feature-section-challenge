This is my solution to the **Four Card Feature Section** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).  
The challenge helped me improve my **HTML and CSS skills** by building a clean, responsive section that displays four feature cards supported by a modern layout.

## Overview
This project is a **responsive feature section layout** that displays four cards, each representing a key element of an AI-powered project management system.  
The cards highlight the ideas of **supervision, team building, karma, and calculation**.  
The layout adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining visual balance through responsive design and clean UI components.

## The Challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the layout clearly across different screen sizes.  
- See the four cards arranged visually in a structured layout.  
- Read each feature with its corresponding icon and description.  
- Experience subtle card shadows and a modern UI look.

## My Process
1. Structured the markup using **semantic HTML** (`header`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `hgroup`) to ensure clarity and accessibility.  
2. Applied **Flexbox** to align the cards and create the three-column layout (with the middle column containing two stacked cards).  
3. Configured **CSS custom properties (variables)** for colors and maintained a consistent theme.  
4. Used **BEM naming conventions** to keep class names scalable and clear.  
5. Created **UI cards** with shadows, padding, and colored top borders for a polished and modern appearance.  
6. Implemented **responsive breakpoints** to adjust the card order and typography on tablet and mobile devices.  
7. Focused on spacing and readability to maintain a clean and minimal interface.
